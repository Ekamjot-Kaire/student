    "\n",
    "Route 53 is the built in DNS (Domain Name System) for AWS. \n",
    "- translates URL web addresses into IP addresses (198.143.164.252)\n",
    "- register domain name\n",

    "\n",
    "1) When a website's domain name is entered into your browser, the device queries a DNS recursive resolver (which finds the IP address connected to the domain name)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The DNS recursive resolver contacts a root nameserver (a master server that maintains a list of all top-level domains (TLDs))\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The root nameserver doesn't have the specific IP address for the requested domain, but it can direct the resolver to the appropriate TLD nameserver\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The DNS recursive resolver, with the information from the root nameserver, contacts the TLD nameserver of the domain entered by the user\n",
    "\n",
    "    - The TLD nameserver contains info about the authoritative nameservers \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The TLD nameserver directs the DNS recursive resolver to the authoritative nameserver for that domain\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The authoritative nameserver returns the IP address for the domain to the DNS recursive resolver, which then sends this IP address to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The user's device, now with the correct IP address, contacts the main website server, and the website can load\n",
