    "### MCQ Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a banking application where you need to represent customer information. You have decided to use both primitive types and reference types for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a) Define primitive types and reference types in Java. Provide examples of each.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive data types are the most base level data type (can't be divided further into smaller data types). They come as part if the Java language, but can be manipulated. An example of a primitive data type is a **boolean**\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference data types are any non-primitive data type. They are not pre-defined, but have to be created by the programmer. Reference data types are not stored in the program itself, but instead using a reference data type creates a connection (reference) to a different memory location which stores that information. AN example of a reference type is a **class**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b) Explain the differences between primitive types and reference types in terms of memory allocation and usage in Java programs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Primitive types are stored in the program itself. They values they store can't be changed once they are defined (though the variable can be reassigned to a new value)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference types are not stored in the program. Instead, we store the reference to a different location, which holds the information we need. Using a reference type means you are accessing that memory location \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c) Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a method `calculateInterest` that takes a primitive `double` type representing the principal amount and a reference type `Customer` representing the customer information. Write  the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code.\n",
